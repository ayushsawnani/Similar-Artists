**Project: Similar Artists Graph Traversal**

Developed a **Java-based graph traversal system** to analyze and discover connections between similar music artists. The system reads artist similarity data from a file and constructs an **undirected graph**, where each **node** represents an artist and each **edge** denotes a similarity relationship.

### **Key Features & Responsibilities:**

- Implemented **graph data structures** using **HashSet** for storing artists and similarity relationships.
- Designed **Depth-First Traversal (DFT)** to explore paths between different artists and identify connections.
- Utilized **Stacks and HashSets** for efficient path tracking and cycle prevention.
- Processed artist similarity data from an input file and dynamically built a **bidirectional** graph representation.
- Developed **custom classes (`Artist`, `Edge`, `Graph`)** to structure and encapsulate data effectively.
- Ensured proper **object equality checks** (`equals()` and `hashCode()`) to maintain graph integrity.
- Printed all discovered artist similarity paths in a readable format.

This project demonstrates **graph traversal algorithms, object-oriented design, and efficient data handling** in Java, making it applicable to **recommendation systems** and **network analysis** applications.
